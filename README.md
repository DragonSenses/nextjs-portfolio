# nextjs-portfolio
 Personal portfolio site made with NextJS and TailwindCSS

# Description

A web portfolio built with NextJS, using [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). Styled with TailwindCSS.

I've developed enthusiasm for NextJS recently and wanted to create a portfolio out of it.

For now this will be a [SPA:Single-Page-Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA).

# Technologies

- NextJS v13.4.7
- TailwindCSS

# Instructions to run a local copy

1. Clone this repository and save to a folder on a laptop (or on GitHub click `Code` > `Download Zip`)

2. Go to the directory (folder) where code is stored 

  ```powershell
  cd /nextjs-portfolio
  ```

3. Run the app locally

Ensure you have Nodejs with `npm` installed.

Enter the commands in the terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open the `url` link on your browser: usually it is:

```sh
http://localhost:3000
